## Description

Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth English), or Xs and Os (Canadian or Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

## Quick start

- To **<g>Win</g>**, three **<r>O</r>** or **<b>X</b>** must be placed **inline** or **diagonally**.Somo is shown in the image.
